# CallBotX: AI-Powered Voice Agents for E-Commerce Support

CallBotX is a platform that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and natural voice interaction to answer user queries about specific products (initially focusing on iPhones 8â€“16). It enables companies to upload their product information and, within minutes, deploy a custom AI assistant capable of handling real customer conversations in both text and voice formats.

## Features

- **AI Voice & Text Agents:** Instantly create AI agents that can interact with customers using natural language via voice and chat.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Uses advanced retrieval techniques to provide accurate, up-to-date answers based on product documentation and FAQs.
- **Rapid Onboarding:** Companies can upload their product information and quickly deploy an AI-powered assistant.
- **Multimodal Support:** Handles both voice and text interactions for seamless customer support.
- **Customizable:** Easily adapt the assistant to support new products and business requirements.
